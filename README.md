# ato-pervasives

**Apero** is collection of OCaml libraries that we use on most of our OCaml code.
These libraries include monoids, applicative functors, monads as well as
some extensions to OCaml Pervasives.

For those wondering what ***Apero*** means, it is the French colloquial version
***Aperitif*** and the contraction of **A**TO **per**vasives **o**util.
